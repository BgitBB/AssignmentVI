    <!-- About -->
    <p>
        I am a student at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology of Addis Ababa University. I am currently studying
        Information Technology at the Information Technology and Software Computing Depatment of the university.
    </p>

    <p>
        I recieved my High School Diploma from Lideta Catholic Cathedral Schooln in July, 2018. I have many interests.
        Math and Physics are one; Technology is another.

        I hope you will know who I am after going through this website. My goal is to understand this world as much as I
        could and make the best of it as much as I can. I may aim too high but I surely won't hit low.
